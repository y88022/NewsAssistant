Excluding non-recurring items, adjusted earnings per share grew to $1.91 from $1.62 and topped the FactSet consensus of $1.62. Revenue rose 8.3% to $66.76 billion to beat the FactSet consensus of $64.08 billion, as revenue for the pharmacy services, retail and long-term care and health care benefits businesses all rose above expectations. The pharmacy businesses benefit from greater use of 90-day prescriptions and early refills amid the COVID-19 pandemic and retail benefit from increased store volume as consumers prepared for COVID-19 related lockdowns.

the coronavirus, and they say that one mutation may put people at risk for a second infection with another mutated version of the virus, according to a preprint shared by the Los Alamos National Laboratory. A preprint is a type of preliminary report that has not been peer-reviewed and is not considered factual. The D614 mutation, which may be replacing the original Wuhan version of the virus, may also heighten the risk of a second infection and may be associated with higher rates of transmissibility. \"Increased infectivity would be consistent with rapid spread,\" the researchers wrote. In the early weeks of the pandemic, the D614 mutation was the most common form of the virus, with exceptions in Italy and Switzerland; however, throughout March, a form of the virus with the G614 mutation began to dominate. The mutations followed a similar path in the U.S., Canada, and some other countries, starting with the D614 form and then a rapid rise of the G614 mutation, which carries a higher viral load in patients. \"The D614 form was the dominant local form early in the epidemic. Wherever G614 entered a population, a rapid rise in its frequency followed, and in many cases G614 became the dominant local form in a matter of only a few weeks,\" they wrote. The researchers also said it's unclear why the D614 version of the virus is replacing the original virus. \"We do not know what is driving this selective sweep,\" they concluded.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

The company had net earnings of $3.4 billion, or 60 cents a share, in the quarter, down from $3.9 billion, or 61 cents per share, in the first quarter of last year.  Adjusted per-share earnings came to 80 cents, compared with the FactSet consensus of 73 cents. Pfizer reported $12.0 billion in revenue in the first months of the year, down 8% from the $13.1 billion it reported in the same quarter a year ago.  The FactSet consensus was for $11.8 billion. The company said it had a $150 million lift in the quarter that can be attributed to an 11% increase in global sales of its hospital products (some of which are used to intubate and support patients on mechanical ventilators) and a 29% jump in sales of its blood-thinner Eliquis, which was driven by COVID-19-related wholesaler purchases. It also restarted some clinical trials and launched new studies in late April after pausing some in March due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Pfizer reaffirmed its 2020 revenue guidance of $48.5 billion to $50.5 billion in 2020 and it also reaffirmed adjusted EPS  of $2.82 to $2.92 for the year. Year-to-date, Pfizer's stock is down 2.1%, while the S&P 500  has declined 10.9%.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

The JAMA Network Open, in a peer-reviewed report, recommended that the use of chloroquine, touted by President Donald Trump, shouldn't be used for the treatment of severe COVID-19, based on preliminary findings. A study of the drug was cut short because the primary outcome of the treatment in higher doses was death, the JNO report showed. The Dow Jones Industrial Average  was trading down 0.2% at 23,475, but had touched a low at 23,417, while the S&P 500 index  was virtually unchanged at 2,799 and the Nasdaq Composite Index  was holding on to a gain of 0.2%. The markets have been on edge this week as investors look for upbeat signs that the U.S. will be able to emerge from lockdowns and stay-at-home procedures but in place to limit the spread of the deadly contagion. Earlier, the Food and Drug Administration also warned against using chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine outside a hospital or formal clinical trial setting.Corrections & Amplifications: An earlier version of this article misidentified the medical publication that authored the report on anti-malarial drugs. The report was from the JAMA Network Open, an open access medical journal published by the American Medical Association. The Journal of the American Medical Association, or JAMA, is a separate peer-reviewed medical journal. MarketWatch apologizes for the error. </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

In addition to Kleenex, Kimberly-Clark brands include Cottonelle and Scott. The company has withdrawn its 2020 guidance due to uncertainty from the pandemic, and it has suspended its share repurchase program until at least the end of the second quarter. Kimberly-Clark has extended its restructuring program until the end of 2021 due to COVID-19, at which point the company expects total charges on the high end of $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion range.
