fund, on Wednesday announced an eight-for-one reverse stock split. The move comes after USO lost one-third of its value in the most recent week amid a worsening global oil glut. USO, which directly tracks oil futures contracts, had earlier attempted to mitigate losses by stretching out its exposure to later-dated oil futures contracts, but on Tuesday said it would abandon a pre-set strategy and invest in contracts in \"any month available.\" On Tuesday, USO had to stop creating new fund shares after it reached a pre-determined threshold of exposure to the underlying securities. By reducing the number of USO shares outstanding, USO's post-split shares will be valued eight times higher than pre-split shares. The step will be completed April 28. USO shares have lost about 78% of their value in the year to date, and many analysts believe retail investors have borne most of those losses in recent weeks. </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.
