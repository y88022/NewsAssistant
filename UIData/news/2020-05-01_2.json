President Trump signed a $484 billion stimulus package that will replenish a fund for small-business lending and direct money to hospitals and efforts to ramp up U.S. testing capacity in the fight against COVID-19. The bill will bring total federal spending on coronvirus to north of $2.7 trillion.

The FactSet consensus is for revenue of $3.4 billion.  Arconic split into two standalone companies - Arconic Corporation and Howmet Aerospace Inc. -- on April 1 and the guidance is based on preliminary unaudited financial results from Howmet reported on April 14. The Pittsburgh, Pa.-based company said it expects cost savings implemented to combat the effect of the virus are expected to improve its financial profile by $200 million in 2020. The company's China facilities are now back to normal product, while its Russian packaging facility is running at full operations due to strong end-market demand. The company's New York facility resumed operations on April 20 and the Tennessee plant is expected to ramp up activity this week. \"We are pleased with the recent announcement on April 22(nd) by the ITC initiating antidumping and countervailing duties trade case against 18 countries on common alloy sheet products and we expect this will benefit our operations and others in industrial aluminum processing,\" Chief Executive Tim Myers said in a statement. Arconic has more than $1 billion in liquidity, including about $500 million in cash on its balance sheet, and its maturities are \"well into the future.\" \"Our business is flexible and cash requirements are countercyclical and we expect working capital will be a source of cash in the near team, and together with the benefit of the recent management actions to reduce costs, we believe we have adequate liquidity to operate the Company in spite of ongoing uncertainties,\" Chief Financial Officer Erick Asmussen said in the statement. </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

The phase 2 study is expected to begin in the second quarter, Moderna said. That will evaluate the safety and any adverse reactions and immune responses of two mRNA-1273 vaccinations given 28 days apart, the company said. Each person participating in the study will be assigned to receive a placebo or different doses of the vaccine candidate, Moderna said. The plan is to enroll 600 healthy adults and older adults in two cohorts, Participants will be followed through 12 months after the second vaccination, Moderna said. \"Submitting this (investigative new-drug application) is an important next step in the clinical development of our mRNA vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, and we are moving rapidly to potentially address this global health emergency,\" Moderna's Chief Medical Officer Tal Zaks said in a statement. A third phase could begin in the fall of 2020, the company said.

That is unchanged from the March forward guidance.

The report was compiled from informtion obtained as of March 12. Wages - some 70% of employment costs  - rose 0.9% in the first quarter. Benefits increased 0.4%, according to the government's closely followed employment cost index. In the 12 months ended in March employment costs increased at an unadjusted 2.8%. The ECI reflects how much companies, governments and nonprofit institutions pay their employees in wages and benefits. What the report showed before the pandemic was that the labor market was very healthy, but it's unclear how employment costs will be affected in the second quarter. Compensation could actually rise since more low-wage workers than high-wage employees have lost their jobs. Or the growth in wages and benefits could both decline sharply. </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

But the company's fattened bottom line was, in large part, due to its real estate of the MGM Grand and Mandalay Bay resorts in Las Vegas. Adjusted for that sale, among other things, losses were 45 cents a share versus earnings of 14 cents a share in the year-ago period. Hurt by shut-down operations in Macau and Las Vegas, among other places, and travel restrictions revenue fell to $2.25 billion from $3.18 billion in the year-ago period. Analysts surveyed by FactSet had estimated adjusted losses of 15 cents a share on revenue of $2.45 billion. MGM said it temporarily has reduced its dividend to a penny a share that will be paid out on an annual basis but will pay out a last quarterly dividend of $0.0025 per share on June 15. The company said it has roughly $7 billion in cash after a recent debt issue. The sale of the MGM Grand and Mandalay Bay real estate was similar to the sale of its flagship Bellagio casino in Las Vegas last year. MGM stock has fallen 36.8% in the past year, with the S&P 500 index  falling 0.2%.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.
