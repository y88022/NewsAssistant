The action comes just hours after Chief Executive Elon Musk tweeted that he'd move Tesla's headquarters in Palo Alto and the Fremont factory out of California. The plant and headquarters are located in counties among the first in the U.S. to issue stay-at-home orders and to order non-essential businesses closed to stem the spread of the coronavirus. Musk has been a vocal critic of the shutdown orders, last week going as far as calling them \"fascist.\" Local health authorities on Friday foiled Tesla's plans to start reopening the factory, clarifying that, despite the reopening of some nonessential businesses elsewhere in the state, their own shutdown order prevailed.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

It's also good news for our suppliers, car dealers and the ecosystems that provide services around them, like restaurants, shops and stores. This economic multiplier effect is going to help reboot communities around the globe,\" Ford Chief Executive Jim Farley said in a statement. The safety measures include scheduling more time between shifts, modifying workplaces to allow for social distancing, and distributing masks and other personal protective equipment to be worn inside the facilities, Ford said. Cafeterias, small meeting rooms, and other common areas where social distance is not possible will remain closed, the company said. Ford will also implement no-touch temperature scans, and require everyone entering a Ford facility to wear masks, the company said. Ford reiterated plans to reopen in Europe by next week, and said a small number of employees have returned to work this week in North America to begin installing equipment for the new safety measures. The company late Tuesday reported a $2 billion loss in its first quarter, and said it expects more losses in the second quarter. </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.
