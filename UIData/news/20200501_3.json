Dine Brands has $395.1 million in cash, including $345 million in unrestricted cash, Joyce said.

Skechers reported net income of $49.1 million, or 32 cents per share, down from $108.8 million, or 71 cents per share. Adjusted EPS of 39 cents was in line with expectations. Sales of $1.24 billion were down from $1.28 billion, but ahead of the $1.22 billion FactSet consensus. Same-store sales at company-owned stores fell 8.1%, including a 4.7% decline in the U.S. and a 16.6% drop internationally due to the spread of the coronavirus. Despite the challenges the pandemic presents, analysts are bullish. \"Skechers is well positioned to emerge from the crisis in a position of strength,\" wrote Susquehanna Financial Group analysts led by Sam Poser. \"The company has ample liquidity, brand momentum, and geographic and channel diversity, which should help Skechers weather the current crisis better than many peers.\" Susquehanna rates Skechers shares positive with a $32 price target. The company says it has $1.3 billion immediately available, including $490 million from an unsecured credit facility. Stifel analysts say the company's speed to market and scale will help it gain footwear category market share. Analysts there rate Skechers stock buy with a $43 price target. Skechers stock has dropped 17.8% while the S&P 500 index  is down 4.2%.
