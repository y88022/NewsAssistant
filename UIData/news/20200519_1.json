The company swung to a net loss of $184 million, or $1.46 a share, from net income of $45 million, or 26 cents a share, in the year-ago period amid mark-to-market losses on oilseed crushing contracts and forward hedges related to its oil pipeline. Excluding non-recurring items, the company reported an adjusted loss per share of $1.34, compared with the FactSet consensus for earnings of 67 cents a share. Sales fell to $9.17 billion from $9.94 billion, while the FactSet consensus was for a rise to $10.19 billion. \"Our underlying business performed well during the quarter, and the mark-to-market adjustments we incurred are expected to reverse in the coming quarters,\" said Chief Executive Greg Heckman.

Sales in North America fell 17%, mostly pinned to a decline in sales of toys geared to younger children, such as Fisher-Price and Thomas & Friends. That was partly offset by sales growth of its Uno and Pictionary games as well as dolls including Barbie. Mattel said it expects its global manufacturing and distribution capacity largely restored and able to meet product demand for the second half of the year. \"We are planning for increased demand for our products in expectation of a much-improved second half and holiday season,\" Mattel said.

Net revenue rose to $1.39 billion from $1.24 billion in the year-ago period and the company reported net bookings fell to $1.21 billion compared with $1.36 billion a year ago. Net bookings are a common non-GAAP figure used by videogame companies to capture digital and physical sales. Analysts surveyed by FactSet had estimated earnings of $1.05 a share on net bookings of $1.18 billion. The company said it expects fiscal 2021 net income of $978 million, which amounts to $3.35 a share, and net bookings of $5.55 billion. The company said it has made a change to how it calculates net bookings for fiscal 2021. The company said that the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on its business will be the result of a number of factors that are currently evolving and the company cannot predict them. The vast majority of the company's global workforce is working from home and its security and technology teams have added capacity to its remote employment system as a result.
