Stat News in a Tuesday afternoon report attempted to throw some cold water on an upbeat study released by Moderna  about its coronavirus vaccine candidate. The Stat News article said that the Moderna report on its experimental remedy for COVID-19 lacked sufficient data. The report of early success from the Moderna vaccine candidate was one of the key catalysts for markets soaring a day ago. The Dow  closed down by about 391 points, or 1.6%, at 24,207, the S&P 500 index  closed down 1.1% at about 2,923 and the Nasdaq Composite Index  ended 0.5% lower at 9,185, giving up its gains for the day in the final half-hour of trading. Moderna shares, meanwhile, finished down by 10.4% in late Tuesday action after a 13% surge on Monday which brought it to a record close. Meanwhile, Boston Federal Reserve President Eric Rosengren during a CNBC interview cautioned that businesses reopening may be \"premature\" as Americans continue to contend psychologically with the COVID-19 pandemic. Rosengren suggested that demand from consumers may still be an issue as the economy attempts to restart from coronavirus-induced closures. The Fed officials comments come after Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin Tuesday morning were grilled by the Senate Banking Committee about why funding from the $2 trillion economic-relief package approved by Congress legislation remains unspent.  </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

All the closing levels are on a preliminary basis. Powell said further fiscal support would be expensive but worth it if it helped bring about a stronger recovery. The scope and speed of this downturn are without modern precedent, significantly worse than any recession since World War II,' Powell said.

Novavax shares surged 16% after hours, following a 31% rally in the regular session to close at $24.50. The company said the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations will invest up to $384 million in the development of NVX-CoV2373, Novavax's vaccine candidate for SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. Funding will be used for combined safety and effectiveness testing of the vaccine, Novavax said. The company also reported a first-quarter loss of $25.9 million, or 58 cents a share, compared a loss of $43.2 million, or $2.11 a share, in the year-ago period. Revenue declined to $3.4 million from $4 million in the year-ago quarter.

Adjusted for one-time items, Hertz said it lost $1.78 a share, compared with a loss of 87 cents a year ago. Revenue fell to $1.92 billion from $2.11 billion a year ago. Analysts polled by FactSet had expected an adjusted loss of $1.21 a share on sales of $1.95 billion. The year started well, Hertz Chief Executive Kathryn V. Marinello said in a statement. \"Yet in just two months, the outbreak of the coronavirus created a major business disruption as global travel demand dropped to almost zero and the U.S. used-car market effectively shut down. We immediately shifted our business priorities to focus on employee and customer safety, expense mitigation and preserving liquidity,\" she said. Hertz said that during the quarter it drew down $595 million from a credit line and ended the period with about $1 billion in cash and cash equivalents. Hertz reportedly has hired advisers to guide it with its debt load and ahead of a possible bankruptcy filing. Shares had ended the regular trading day down 2.5%. </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

The company reported first-quarter net income of $505 million, or 65 cents a share, compared with $447 million, or 58 cents a share, in the year-ago period. Adjusted for items such as stock-based compensation, among other things, earnings were 76 cents a share. Revenue fell to $1.79 billion from $1.83 billion in the year-ago period; Activision reported net bookings rose to $1.52 billion compared with $1.26 billion a year ago. Bookings is a common non-GAAP financial measure used by videogame companies to capture revenue from digital and physical sales. Analysts surveyed by FactSet had estimated adjusted earnings of 38 cents a share on net bookings of $1.32 billion. The videogame maker said it saw better-than-expected results for its key franchises as populations sheltering at home turned to its various titles for entertainment and social connection. Activision said it expects full-year earnings of $2.22 a share on sales of $6.8 billion. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the company said its staff had moved to work from home in mid-March. The company said that while working remotely brings challenges, it has implemented measures to address those areas, and based on what it has accomplished so far \"we expect to deliver a robust slate of content over the remainder of the year.\" Activision stock has gained 45% in the past year, as the S&P 500 index  fell 3.5%.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

Pinterest pre-announced some results in early April. The company posted a net loss of $141 million, or 25 cents a share, after a loss of $41 million, or 33 cents a share, in the year-earlier quarter. Pinterest recorded an adjusted loss of 10 cents a share, compared with its loss of 32 cents a share a year prior. Analysts surveyed by FactSet were modeling a net loss per share of 9 cents. Pinterest's revenue grew to $272 million from $202 million, while analysts were calling for $269 million. The company said it had 367 million monthly active users in the quarter. Analysts expected 363 million after the preannouncement. \"Our cost of revenue has generally grown with users rather than revenue, which in this environment puts some pressure on gross margins,\" Pinterest said in a release. \"We expect to continue to grow operating expenses in Q220 year over year, but at a slower pace compared to Q120.\" The COVID-19 outbreak has \"certainly had an impact on our business and the businesses of our advertisers,\" Chief Financial Officer Todd Morganfeld said in a statement. Pinterest shares have declined 5% over the past three months as the S&P 500  has declined 14%. </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.
