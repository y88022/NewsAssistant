The report was compiled from informtion obtained as of March 12. Wages - some 70% of employment costs  - rose 0.9% in the first quarter. Benefits increased 0.4%, according to the government's closely followed employment cost index. In the 12 months ended in March employment costs increased at an unadjusted 2.8%. The ECI reflects how much companies, governments and nonprofit institutions pay their employees in wages and benefits. What the report showed before the pandemic was that the labor market was very healthy, but it's unclear how employment costs will be affected in the second quarter. Compensation could actually rise since more low-wage workers than high-wage employees have lost their jobs.

"description": "<p>U.S. stocks midday Thursday took a firm leg down midday but finished off the worst levels of the session after the Washington Post reported that U.S. officials were \"crafting retaliatory actions against China' as the Trump administration criticizes the world's second-largest economy for its handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Dow Jones Industrial Average  lost 288 points, or 1.2%, at 24,346, the S&P 500 index  ended off 0.9% and the Nasdaq Composite Index  dropped 0.3%, with all the benchmarks closing well off their worst levels of the day. The coronavirus was first identified in Wuhan, China in December and Trump has recently railed against what he has described as the country's lack of transparency around the severity of the outbreak. Meanwhile, the New York Times reported the Trump officials have \"pushed American spy agencies to hunt for evidence to support\" an unsubstantiated theory that the novel strain of coronavirus was derived from a laboratory in Wuhan. The pandemic has infected more than 3 million people world-wide and claimed more than 230,000 lives, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.
