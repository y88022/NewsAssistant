premarket trade Friday, after the cosmetics company beat earnings estimates for its fiscal third quarter, though it warned of pain ahead with retail stores likely to remain closed in the fourth quarter. The company swung to a loss of $6 million, or 2 cents a share, in the quarter, after earnings of $555 million, or $1.51 a share, in the year-earlier period. The loss was mostly due to a $346 million, or 83 cents a share, impairment charge across Too Faced, GLAMGLOW, BECCA, Smashbox and certain of its freestanding stores, caused by the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, which has shuttered stores around the world. Excluding that charge, the company had EPS of 85 cents, ahead of the 74 cents FactSet consensus. Sales rose 11% to $3.35 billion, also ahead of the $3.05 billion FactSet consensus. The company is expecting the fourth quarter to be hurt by continued stores closures and is not providing guidance. Shares have fallen 15% in the year to date, while the S&P 500  has fallen 10%. </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

before falling back about 1%, after the fast-food giant missed on profit but beat revenue estimates for the first quarter, even after many of its restaurants were forced to close during the coronavirus pandemic. McDonald's said it had net income of $1.107 billion, or $1.47 a share, in the quarter, down from $1.328 billion, or $1.72 a share, in the year-earlier period. Revenue fell 6% to $4.714 billion from $5.024 billion. The FactSet consensus was for EPS of $1.57 and revenue of $4.670 billion. Same-restaurant sales fell 3.4%, matching the FactSet consensus. The company said sales were hit by restaurant closures, limited operations and dramatic changes in consumer behavior. About 75% of its restaurants are still open, offering drive-through, delivery and/or take-away service. In the U.S. 99% of restaurants are open, although with limited menus and hours in some cases. China is 99% open again, although demand has fallen as consumers have not fully returned to their pre-pandemic habits, said the company. Shares have fallen 5% in the year to date, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average  has fallen 14% and the S&P 500  has fallen 10%. </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

The airline said it's adjusted per-share loss came to $2.65, compared with a FactSet consensus for a loss per share of just $2.08. Revenue fell 19.6% to $8.515 billion from $10.584 billion. The FactSet consensus was for revenue of $9.255 billion. \"Never before has our airline, or our industry, faced such a significant challenge,\" Chief Executive Doug Parker said in a statement. Like its rivals, American has been hammered as consumers have stopped flying during the coronavirus pandemic with many states and regions under strict lockdown regimes to prevent the spread of the illness. \"We have moved quickly and aggressively to reduce our costs and bolster our liquidity,\" Parker said. The carrier ended the quarter with $6.8 billion in liquidity, and has access to $10.8 billion in financial assistance through the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. The company said it views its unencumbered assets as having a value of more than $10 billion and expects to pledge some of those as collateral for future financing, including the roughly $4.75 billion secured loan it has applied for under the CARES Act. It expects its second-quarter cash burn to come to about $70 million a day. The airline has taken a series of measures to prepare for the gradual reopening of economies, including new cleaning protocols and ordering team members to wear face masks. It is extending travel waivers through the end of September. Shares rose 1.9% premarket but have fallen 69% in the year to date, while the S&P 500  has fallen 10%. </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

But the company's fattened bottom line was, in large part, due to its real estate of the MGM Grand and Mandalay Bay resorts in Las Vegas. Adjusted for that sale, among other things, losses were 45 cents a share versus earnings of 14 cents a share in the year-ago period. Hurt by shut-down operations in Macau and Las Vegas, among other places, and travel restrictions revenue fell to $2.25 billion from $3.18 billion in the year-ago period. Analysts surveyed by FactSet had estimated adjusted losses of 15 cents a share on revenue of $2.45 billion. MGM said it temporarily has reduced its dividend to a penny a share that will be paid out on an annual basis but will pay out a last quarterly dividend of $0.0025 per share on June 15. The company said it has roughly $7 billion in cash after a recent debt issue. The sale of the MGM Grand and Mandalay Bay real estate was similar to the sale of its flagship Bellagio casino in Las Vegas last year. MGM stock has fallen 36.8% in the past year, with the S&P 500 index  falling 0.2%.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.
