Novavax shares surged 16% after hours, following a 31% rally in the regular session to close at $24.50. The company said the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations will invest up to $384 million in the development of NVX-CoV2373, Novavax's vaccine candidate for SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. Funding will be used for combined safety and effectiveness testing of the vaccine, Novavax said. The company also reported a first-quarter loss of $25.9 million, or 58 cents a share, compared a loss of $43.2 million, or $2.11 a share, in the year-ago period.

Adjusted for one-time items, Hertz said it lost $1.78 a share, compared with a loss of 87 cents a year ago. Revenue fell to $1.92 billion from $2.11 billion a year ago. Analysts polled by FactSet had expected an adjusted loss of $1.21 a share on sales of $1.95 billion. The year started well, Hertz Chief Executive Kathryn V. Marinello said in a statement. \"Yet in just two months, the outbreak of the coronavirus created a major business disruption as global travel demand dropped to almost zero and the U.S. used-car market effectively shut down. We immediately shifted our business priorities to focus on employee and customer safety, expense mitigation and preserving liquidity,\" she said. Hertz said that during the quarter it drew down $595 million from a credit line and ended the period with about $1 billion in cash and cash equivalents. Hertz reportedly has hired advisers to guide it with its debt load and ahead of a possible bankruptcy filing. Shares had ended the regular trading day down 2.5%. </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

The company reported first-quarter net income of $505 million, or 65 cents a share, compared with $447 million, or 58 cents a share, in the year-ago period. Adjusted for items such as stock-based compensation, among other things, earnings were 76 cents a share. Revenue fell to $1.79 billion from $1.83 billion in the year-ago period; Activision reported net bookings rose to $1.52 billion compared with $1.26 billion a year ago. Bookings is a common non-GAAP financial measure used by videogame companies to capture revenue from digital and physical sales. Analysts surveyed by FactSet had estimated adjusted earnings of 38 cents a share on net bookings of $1.32 billion. The videogame maker said it saw better-than-expected results for its key franchises as populations sheltering at home turned to its various titles for entertainment and social connection. Activision said it expects full-year earnings of $2.22 a share on sales of $6.8 billion. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the company said its staff had moved to work from home in mid-March. The company said that while working remotely brings challenges, it has implemented measures to address those areas, and based on what it has accomplished so far \"we expect to deliver a robust slate of content over the remainder of the year.\" Activision stock has gained 45% in the past year, as the S&P 500 index  fell 3.5%.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

Pinterest pre-announced some results in early April. The company posted a net loss of $141 million, or 25 cents a share, after a loss of $41 million, or 33 cents a share, in the year-earlier quarter. Pinterest recorded an adjusted loss of 10 cents a share, compared with its loss of 32 cents a share a year prior. Analysts surveyed by FactSet were modeling a net loss per share of 9 cents. Pinterest's revenue grew to $272 million from $202 million, while analysts were calling for $269 million. The company said it had 367 million monthly active users in the quarter. Analysts expected 363 million after the preannouncement. \"Our cost of revenue has generally grown with users rather than revenue, which in this environment puts some pressure on gross margins,\" Pinterest said in a release. \"We expect to continue to grow operating expenses in Q220 year over year, but at a slower pace compared to Q120.\" The COVID-19 outbreak has \"certainly had an impact on our business and the businesses of our advertisers,\" Chief Financial Officer Todd Morganfeld said in a statement.

More than two dozen U.S. have begun to allow select businesses to open or announce plans to do in May, but local and federal officials are also facing climbing cases of novel cases of coronavirus, albeit, at a slower pace. The COVID-19 pandemic has killed nearly 250,000 people world-wide and infected 3.5 million, with 1.154 million in the U.S. alone, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. Meanwhile, investors may pay close attention to the airline industry after Warren Buffett, during an annual shareholder meeting on Saturday, said that his Berkshire Hathaway   had sold all of its stake in major airlines, Delta Air Lines Inc. , Southwest Airlines , United Airlines-parent United Airlines Holdings Inc.  and American Airlines . On Friday, the Dow fell 622.03 points, or 2.6%, to end at 23,723.69, while the S&P 500 gave up 81.72 points, or 2.8%, to settle at 2,830.71.

beat earnings estimates for its fiscal third quarter, though it warned of pain ahead with retail stores likely to remain closed in the fourth quarter. The company swung to a loss of $6 million, or 2 cents a share, in the quarter, after earnings of $555 million, or $1.51 a share, in the year-earlier period. The loss was mostly due to a $346 million, or 83 cents a share, impairment charge across Too Faced, GLAMGLOW, BECCA, Smashbox and certain of its freestanding stores, caused by the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, which has shuttered stores around the world. Excluding that charge, the company had EPS of 85 cents, ahead of the 74 cents FactSet consensus. Sales rose 11% to $3.35 billion, also ahead of the $3.05 billion FactSet consensus. The company is expecting the fourth quarter to be hurt by continued stores closures and is not providing guidance. Shares have fallen 15% in the year to date, while the S&P 500  has fallen 10%. </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

The airline said it's adjusted per-share loss came to $2.65, compared with a FactSet consensus for a loss per share of just $2.08. Revenue fell 19.6% to $8.515 billion from $10.584 billion. The FactSet consensus was for revenue of $9.255 billion. \"Never before has our airline, or our industry, faced such a significant challenge,\" Chief Executive Doug Parker said in a statement. Like its rivals, American has been hammered as consumers have stopped flying during the coronavirus pandemic with many states and regions under strict lockdown regimes to prevent the spread of the illness. \"We have moved quickly and aggressively to reduce our costs and bolster our liquidity,\" Parker said. The carrier ended the quarter with $6.8 billion in liquidity, and has access to $10.8 billion in financial assistance through the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. The company said it views its unencumbered assets as having a value of more than $10 billion and expects to pledge some of those as collateral for future financing, including the roughly $4.75 billion secured loan it has applied for under the CARES Act. It expects its second-quarter cash burn to come to about $70 million a day. The airline has taken a series of measures to prepare for the gradual reopening of economies, including new cleaning protocols and ordering team members to wear face masks. It is extending travel waivers through the end of September. Shares rose 1.9% premarket but have fallen 69% in the year to date, while the S&P 500  has fallen 10%. </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

The report was compiled from informtion obtained as of March 12. Wages - some 70% of employment costs  - rose 0.9% in the first quarter. Benefits increased 0.4%, according to the government's closely followed employment cost index. In the 12 months ended in March employment costs increased at an unadjusted 2.8%. The ECI reflects how much companies, governments and nonprofit institutions pay their employees in wages and benefits. What the report showed before the pandemic was that the labor market was very healthy, but it's unclear how employment costs will be affected in the second quarter.

But the company's fattened bottom line was, in large part, due to its real estate of the MGM Grand and Mandalay Bay resorts in Las Vegas. Adjusted for that sale, among other things, losses were 45 cents a share versus earnings of 14 cents a share in the year-ago period. Hurt by shut-down operations in Macau and Las Vegas, among other places, and travel restrictions revenue fell to $2.25 billion from $3.18 billion in the year-ago period. Analysts surveyed by FactSet had estimated adjusted losses of 15 cents a share on revenue of $2.45 billion. MGM said it temporarily has reduced its dividend to a penny a share that will be paid out on an annual basis but will pay out a last quarterly dividend of $0.0025 per share on June 15. The company said it has roughly $7 billion in cash after a recent debt issue. The sale of the MGM Grand and Mandalay Bay real estate was similar to the sale of its flagship Bellagio casino in Las Vegas last year.
