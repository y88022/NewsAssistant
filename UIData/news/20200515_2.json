Trading volume was 27.4 million shares, which was more than 7-times the full-day average. Uber's stock rallied 5.9%. The Wall Street Journal said the food delivery company had responded to Uber's proposal by seeking 2.15 Uber shares for each GrubHub share outstanding. Based on Monday's stock closing prices, that would value GrubHub shares at $68.03, implying a market capitalization of about $6.25 billion. GrubHub said that while it won't comment on stock moves, it is always looking at value-enhancing opportunities and has said in the past that consolidation would make sense for the industry, the WSJ reported. Year to date, GrubHub's stock has rallied 29.3%, Uber shares have gained 12.7% and the S&P 500  has declined 9.8%.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

Excluding non-recurring items, the company swung to a per-share loss of 79 cents from a profit of $1.68, but beat the FactSet consensus for a loss of $1.27 a share. Revenue dropped 45% to $1.08 billion, but was above the FactSet consensus of $1.02 billion, as beats by its fuselage systems wing systems businesses offset a miss by its propulsion systems business. Among actions the company has taken preserve liquidity and cut costs amid the COVID-19 pandemic include cutting the dividend, suspending share buybacks, deferring repayments of an advance from Boeing and cutting jobs and work schedules.

Net income totaled $364 million, or $1 per share, down from $426 million, or $1.17 per share, last year. Adjusted EPS of 77 cents missed the FactSet consensus for $1.04. Sales of $10.89 billion were down from $10.44 billion last year and below the FactSet outlook for $10.96 billion. Tyson's portfolio of brands includes the namesake, Jimmy Dean and Hillshire Farm. The company said it expects global demand for its meat and prepared foods to grow throughout the COVID-19 outbreak. \"Operationally, we have and expect to continue to face slowdowns and temporary idling of production facilities from team member shortages or choices we make to ensure operational safety,\" the company said in the earnings release. \"The lower levels of productivity and higher costs of production we have experienced will likely continue in the short term until the effects of COVID-19 diminish.\" Last week, President Trump ordered meat plants to remain open, and spoke with Tyson Foods Chief Executive Noel White as well as other food industry leaders. Concerns have risen about a meat shortage due to plant closures from the coronavirus outbreaks. Tyson stock has tumbled 20.1% over the last year while the S&P 500 index  is down 3.9% for the period.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

Excluding non-recurring items, such as the amortization of assets and acquisition-related charges, adjusted earning per share came to 58 cents, above the FactSet consensus of 22 cents. Sales rose 49% to $7.00 billion, primarily because of the acquisitions of Eby-Brown Co. and Reinhart Foodservice, but was below the FactSet consensus of $7.20 billion. Case volume rose 26.4%; excluding Reinhart, independent cases fell 2.7%. Among actions taken as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, the company has furloughed 3,500 employees, deferred 25% of senior management's base salaries, discontinues share repurchases, raised $349 million in the equity markets and $275 million in the fixed income markets and drew $400 million from its $3.0 billion credit facility.

In a press release published on April 7, Chief Executive Tom Berman said the company was \"eager to join the Covid-19 fight.\" Berman said: \"We have accelerated the development and commercialization efforts of our household cleaning and protectant solutions in order to help create a cleaner and safer world\". In the same release, the company changed its name from PEN Inc. and adopted a new ticker symbol. The stock last traded at $1.97, and has gained about 234% in the year to date. The SEC has halted more than 25 stocks over false claims made by companies and third parties relating to tests, treatments or cures for COVID-19, which has sickened more than 3 million people around the world. </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

Morgan downgraded Gilead to neutral from overweight. \"Remdesivir has been a big sentiment boost for GILD (if not the entire market) and the company should be commended for its efforts in so quickly addressing this public health emergency, but we still feel it's unlikely to result in tangible long-term cash flows,\" J.P. Morgan analysts wrote. On Thursday, Gilead released its first-quarter earnings and much of the earning call focused on analyst questions about the business model for remdesivir, which may be nearing an emergency use authorization (EUA) from the Food and Drug Administration for COVID-19 patients. CEO Daniel O'Day told analysts that under an EUA the company can charge for the drug; however, it plans to donate doses through May, saying it \"is the right thing to do.\" Gilead's stock is up 29.7% year-to-date, while the S&P 500  is down 9.8%. </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

The day's losses wiped out weekly gains and were mostly reflective of the magnitude of the surge in the prior month and concerns about the earnings prospects for the likes of Amazon.com Inc.  and Apple Inc. , dominant technology-related firms that have been at the vanguard of a recovery for the market from a coronavirus-induced selloff that hit a low in late March. On Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average  closed down more than 622 points, or 2.6%, at 23,724, marking its worst day since April 21, while the S&P 500 index  ended down 2.8% at around 2,831 and the Nasdaq Composite Index  closed down 3.2% at about 8,604. For the week, the Dow ended off 0.2%, the S&P 500 booked a 0.2% weekly decline and the Nasdaq looked a 5-session loss of 0.3%. Shares of Amazon ended the session down by more than 7% after the company said that it would use its profits to spend on protecting its workers during the COVID-19 pandemic, raising the question about costs for companies during the public health crisis. Separately, shares of electric-vehicle maker Tesla Inc.  finished the session off by more than 10% after its CEO Elon Musk tweeted that the share price of the company had gotten too high. Shares of Apple finished down 1.6% after the company declined to provide guidance for its coming quarter. Investors also were watching developments between the U.S. and China amid threats of tariff retaliation against the world's second-largest economy for its handling of the novel strain of coronavirus, which was first identified in Wuhan in December.   </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.
