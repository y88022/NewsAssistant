In a follow-up to positive preliminary data released last month, NIAID revealed Friday that peer-reviewed data showed that patients recovered enough to be released from the hospital in 11 days against 14 for those who received a placebo. It also noted that the 14-day mortality rate for those on the drug declined to 7.1% from 11.9% for the placebo group, though NIAID is still investigating combinations that could produce a more statistically significant change -- a clinical trial that began May 8 is studying remdesivir in combination with anti-inflammatory drug baricitinib to study those results. The Food and Drug Administration has granted Gilead emergency-use authorization for the drug to use on severely ill COVID-19 patients, and Gilead has signed deals for manufacturing. Gilead stock was 0.4% lower in after-hours trading Friday following the announcement; shares have gained 12.9% so far this year, as the S&P 500 index  has declined 8.5%.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

A representative for the company said it had no comment. The SEC has been cracking down on companies over claims made by them or by third parties regarding products for testing, treating or preventing COVID-19 and has warned investors to beware of scams. </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

Trading volume spiked to 178 million shares, already a one-day record for the stock which went public in July 2010, and enough to make the stock the most actively traded on major U.S. exchanges. The company said before the open that the deal with JFKIAT is for a new modular constructed testing facility within JFK's Terminal 4, which will host new separate testing rooms with a capacity of 500 tests per day. The testing service will be reserved for airline employees, contractors and workers, concessionaires, TSA officers and U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents. The company said it was working with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey on other testing locations.

The FTC has already bought one such case against Marc Ching, doing business as Whole Leaf Organics, it said.
