The company swung to a net loss of $184 million, or $1.46 a share, from net income of $45 million, or 26 cents a share, in the year-ago period amid mark-to-market losses on oilseed crushing contracts and forward hedges related to its oil pipeline. Excluding non-recurring items, the company reported an adjusted loss per share of $1.34, compared with the FactSet consensus for earnings of 67 cents a share. Sales fell to $9.17 billion from $9.94 billion, while the FactSet consensus was for a rise to $10.19 billion. \"Our underlying business performed well during the quarter, and the mark-to-market adjustments we incurred are expected to reverse in the coming quarters,\" said Chief Executive Greg Heckman. The company said it expects 2020 EPS to be lower than its original expectation. The stock has dropped 29.3% over the past three months through Tuesday, while the S&P 500  has lost 14.3%.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

Virgin said it had a \"strong\" cash position, with cash and cash equivalents of $419 million as of March 31. Virgin said the \"full impact\" of the coronavirus pandemic \"will depend on future developments, such as the ultimate duration and scope of the outbreak, the timing and impact of future stay-at-home orders and other government mandates, and the pace at which the company can resume normal course operations.\" Virgin Galactic said it will provide updates \"as appropriate\" but offered no outlook on Tuesday. In a separate press release, Virgin said it and a subsidiary had entered an agreement with NASA to develop technologies for high speeds with an eye for civilian applications.

Mattel withdrew its 2020 guidance \"due to uncertainty related to COVID-19,\" it said. Sales in North America fell 17%, mostly pinned to a decline in sales of toys geared to younger children, such as Fisher-Price and Thomas & Friends. That was partly offset by sales growth of its Uno and Pictionary games as well as dolls including Barbie. Mattel said it expects its global manufacturing and distribution capacity largely restored and able to meet product demand for the second half of the year. \"We are planning for increased demand for our products in expectation of a much-improved second half and holiday season,\" Mattel said. The toy maker said it expects its liquidity, which includes $1.6 billion in revolving credit facilities, to be \"sufficient to effectively manage through COVID-19 disruption and to continue to execute strategy.\" Shares of Mattel had ended the regular trading day up 0.3%. </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

Net income totaled $364 million, or $1 per share, down from $426 million, or $1.17 per share, last year. Adjusted EPS of 77 cents missed the FactSet consensus for $1.04. Sales of $10.89 billion were down from $10.44 billion last year and below the FactSet outlook for $10.96 billion. Tyson's portfolio of brands includes the namesake, Jimmy Dean and Hillshire Farm. The company said it expects global demand for its meat and prepared foods to grow throughout the COVID-19 outbreak. \"Operationally, we have and expect to continue to face slowdowns and temporary idling of production facilities from team member shortages or choices we make to ensure operational safety,\" the company said in the earnings release. \"The lower levels of productivity and higher costs of production we have experienced will likely continue in the short term until the effects of COVID-19 diminish.\" Last week, President Trump ordered meat plants to remain open, and spoke with Tyson Foods Chief Executive Noel White as well as other food industry leaders. Concerns have risen about a meat shortage due to plant closures from the coronavirus outbreaks. Tyson stock has tumbled 20.1% over the last year while the S&P 500 index  is down 3.9% for the period.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

The company swung to a net loss of $40.2 million, or 35 cents a share, from net income of $32.3 million, or 31 cents a share, in the year-ago period. Excluding non-recurring items, such as the amortization of assets and acquisition-related charges, adjusted earning per share came to 58 cents, above the FactSet consensus of 22 cents. Sales rose 49% to $7.00 billion, primarily because of the acquisitions of Eby-Brown Co. and Reinhart Foodservice, but was below the FactSet consensus of $7.20 billion. Case volume rose 26.4%; excluding Reinhart, independent cases fell 2.7%. Among actions taken as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, the company has furloughed 3,500 employees, deferred 25% of senior management's base salaries, discontinues share repurchases, raised $349 million in the equity markets and $275 million in the fixed income markets and drew $400 million from its $3.0 billion credit facility.

Raymond James downgraded the drugmaker's shares to market perform from outperform; analyst Steven Seedhouse attributed the downgrade to a lack of clarity around the commercial viability of remdesivir, an experimental COVID-19 treatment, as well as the drug's \"seemingly de minimis activity\" in preliminary clinical trial data released this week. \"We don't know what a sustainable revenue stream from remdesivir will look like,\" SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analysts wrote in a note, downgrading the stock to sell from hold. J.P. Morgan downgraded Gilead to neutral from overweight. \"Remdesivir has been a big sentiment boost for GILD (if not the entire market) and the company should be commended for its efforts in so quickly addressing this public health emergency, but we still feel it's unlikely to result in tangible long-term cash flows,\" J.P. Morgan analysts wrote. On Thursday, Gilead released its first-quarter earnings and much of the earning call focused on analyst questions about the business model for remdesivir, which may be nearing an emergency use authorization (EUA) from the Food and Drug Administration for COVID-19 patients. CEO Daniel O'Day told analysts that under an EUA the company can charge for the drug; however, it plans to donate doses through May, saying it \"is the right thing to do.\" Gilead's stock is up 29.7% year-to-date, while the S&P 500  is down 9.8%. </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

In a press release published on April 7, Chief Executive Tom Berman said the company was \"eager to join the Covid-19 fight.

The day's losses wiped out weekly gains and were mostly reflective of the magnitude of the surge in the prior month and concerns about the earnings prospects for the likes of Amazon.com Inc.  and Apple Inc. , dominant technology-related firms that have been at the vanguard of a recovery for the market from a coronavirus-induced selloff that hit a low in late March. On Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average  closed down more than 622 points, or 2.6%, at 23,724, marking its worst day since April 21, while the S&P 500 index  ended down 2.8% at around 2,831 and the Nasdaq Composite Index  closed down 3.2% at about 8,604. For the week, the Dow ended off 0.2%, the S&P 500 booked a 0.2% weekly decline and the Nasdaq looked a 5-session loss of 0.3%. Shares of Amazon ended the session down by more than 7% after the company said that it would use its profits to spend on protecting its workers during the COVID-19 pandemic, raising the question about costs for companies during the public health crisis. Separately, shares of electric-vehicle maker Tesla Inc.  finished the session off by more than 10% after its CEO Elon Musk tweeted that the share price of the company had gotten too high. Shares of Apple finished down 1.6% after the company declined to provide guidance for its coming quarter. Investors also were watching developments between the U.S. and China amid threats of tariff retaliation against the world's second-largest economy for its handling of the novel strain of coronavirus, which was first identified in Wuhan in December.   </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

Molson Coors had a first-quarter net loss of $117 million, or 54 cents per share, after income of $151.4 million, or 70 cents per share, last year. Adjusted EPS of 35 cents beat the FactSet consensus for 33 cents. Sales of $2.54 billion were down from $2.80 billion and ahead of the $2.23 billion FactSet outlook. \"We currently expect a significant adverse impact, particularly in the second quarter of 2020, to both net sales and profit performance for fiscal year 2020, and, possibly, beyond, due to the resulting closure of the on-premise channel in effectively all of our markets, as well as the anticipated negative impact of the pandemic on the global economy,\" the company said. Molson Coors estimates that off-premise sales accounted for 23% of the 2019 tally, 17% in North America and 50% to 55% in Europe. \"[I]n nearly all of our markets the on-premise business has been effectively reduced to zero,\" the company said. Molson Coors, like many companies, benefited from pantry-loading in March due to COVID-19, but the company said sales were down 14% for the first four weeks in April. Molson Coors took a $50 million charge, including $31.5 million in lost sales, in the first quarter for a voluntary keg relief program that allowed on-premise venue customers to be reimbursed for untapped kegs. Molson Coors is taking money-saving measures like reducing 2020 capital expenditures by $200 million and furloughing certain employees in Europe and across the North American hospitality business. Molson Coors stock has tumbled 28.1% over the past year while the S&P 500 index  is down 0.2% for the period.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

Apple  and Amazon  reported earnings after the market closed, with Apple reporting a dip in profits but growing sales, but the tech giant said it would not give third-quarter guidance due to uncertainty caused by the pandemic. Amazon beat analysts' earnings estimates, but warned it might lose money in the current quarter as it ramps up spending to deal with the pandemic. Both companies' stock fell in the extended session. Earlier in the day, U.S. stocks ended lower as investors weighed mixed corporate earnings and a report that the Trump administration was considering retaliating against China for its handling of the coronavirus. Still, for the month, the Dow  gained 11.1%, while the S&P 500  ended up 12.7%, representing their best monthly gains since 1987 and their best April performances since 1938, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The Nasdaq  ended up 15.5%, its best monthly advance since 2000 and its best April on record.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

Boeing swung to a net loss of $641 million, or $1.11 a share, from net income of $2.15 billion, or $3.75 a share, in the year-ago period.

Free cash flow swung to a negative $4.73 billion from positive $2.29 billion, but that beat the FactSet consensus of negative $5.79 billion. Commercial airplane revenue fell 48% to $6.21 billion, but was above expectations of $5.94 billion, while defense, space and security revenue declined 8% to $6.04 billion versus expectations of a rise to $6.76 billion. Actions Boeing has taken to amid the COVID-19 pandemic include plans to reduce staffing levels with a voluntary layoff program, reducing commercial airplane production rates and additional workforce actions as necessary. Boeing said \"abnormal production costs\" from the suspension of 737 MAX production have increased by $1 billion to an estimated total of $5 billion.
