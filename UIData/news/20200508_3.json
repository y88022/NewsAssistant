That has led states and local governments to compete for essential supplies, sending prices higher. The letter says the American Health Care Association is reporting that three quarters of its members are running out of PPE, including gowns and masks, and about 60% have started to make their own. Testing is another problem, and a key to keeping health professionals safe. \"More than two months into the pandemic crisis, my colleagues on the front lines still lack adequate PPE and cannot provide SARS-CoV-2 testing for many of their patients. Ensuring a steady and reliable pipeline for both PPE and for supplies needed to administer widespread testing is a vital prerequisite to safely reopening large swaths of the country,\" said Justin Lowenthal, co-chair of the COVID Response Taskforce & Member of the National Board of Directors, Doctors for America. \"Federal coordination is needed to ensure that our health care professionals can safely administer COVID-19 tests and effectively treat those who become sick.\" </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.
