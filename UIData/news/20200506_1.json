The company reported first-quarter net income of $505 million, or 65 cents a share, compared with $447 million, or 58 cents a share, in the year-ago period. Adjusted for items such as stock-based compensation, among other things, earnings were 76 cents a share. Revenue fell to $1.79 billion from $1.83 billion in the year-ago period; Activision reported net bookings rose to $1.52 billion compared with $1.26 billion a year ago. Bookings is a common non-GAAP financial measure used by videogame companies to capture revenue from digital and physical sales. Analysts surveyed by FactSet had estimated adjusted earnings of 38 cents a share on net bookings of $1.32 billion. The videogame maker said it saw better-than-expected results for its key franchises as populations sheltering at home turned to its various titles for entertainment and social connection. Activision said it expects full-year earnings of $2.22 a share on sales of $6.8 billion. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the company said its staff had moved to work from home in mid-March. The company said that while working remotely brings challenges, it has implemented measures to address those areas, and based on what it has accomplished so far \"we expect to deliver a robust slate of content over the remainder of the year.\" Activision stock has gained 45% in the past year, as the S&P 500 index  fell 3.5%.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

Futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average   were off 288 points, or 1.2%, at 23,331, those for the S&P 500 index   declined 31.45 points, or 1%, at 2,790.25, while Nasdaq-100 futures  retreated 88.25 points, or 1%, at 8,629.75. More than two dozen U.S. have begun to allow select businesses to open or announce plans to do in May, but local and federal officials are also facing climbing cases of novel cases of coronavirus, albeit, at a slower pace. The COVID-19 pandemic has killed nearly 250,000 people world-wide and infected 3.5 million, with 1.154 million in the U.S. alone, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. Meanwhile, investors may pay close attention to the airline industry after Warren Buffett, during an annual shareholder meeting on Saturday, said that his Berkshire Hathaway   had sold all of its stake in major airlines, Delta Air Lines Inc. , Southwest Airlines , United Airlines-parent United Airlines Holdings Inc.  and American Airlines . On Friday, the Dow fell 622.03 points, or 2.6%, to end at 23,723.69, while the S&P 500 gave up 81.72 points, or 2.8%, to settle at 2,830.71.

The company swung to a loss of $6 million, or 2 cents a share, in the quarter, after earnings of $555 million, or $1.51 a share, in the year-earlier period. The loss was mostly due to a $346 million, or 83 cents a share, impairment charge across Too Faced, GLAMGLOW, BECCA, Smashbox and certain of its freestanding stores, caused by the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, which has shuttered stores around the world. Excluding that charge, the company had EPS of 85 cents, ahead of the 74 cents FactSet consensus. Sales rose 11% to $3.35 billion, also ahead of the $3.05 billion FactSet consensus. The company is expecting the fourth quarter to be hurt by continued stores closures and is not providing guidance. Shares have fallen 15% in the year to date, while the S&P 500  has fallen 10%. </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

The FactSet consensus was for revenue of $9.255 billion. \"Never before has our airline, or our industry, faced such a significant challenge,\" Chief Executive Doug Parker said in a statement. Like its rivals, American has been hammered as consumers have stopped flying during the coronavirus pandemic with many states and regions under strict lockdown regimes to prevent the spread of the illness. \"We have moved quickly and aggressively to reduce our costs and bolster our liquidity,\" Parker said. The carrier ended the quarter with $6.8 billion in liquidity, and has access to $10.8 billion in financial assistance through the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. The company said it views its unencumbered assets as having a value of more than $10 billion and expects to pledge some of those as collateral for future financing, including the roughly $4.75 billion secured loan it has applied for under the CARES Act. It expects its second-quarter cash burn to come to about $70 million a day. The airline has taken a series of measures to prepare for the gradual reopening of economies, including new cleaning protocols and ordering team members to wear face masks. It is extending travel waivers through the end of September.

The report was compiled from informtion obtained as of March 12. Wages - some 70% of employment costs  - rose 0.9% in the first quarter. Benefits increased 0.4%, according to the government's closely followed employment cost index. In the 12 months ended in March employment costs increased at an unadjusted 2.8%. The ECI reflects how much companies, governments and nonprofit institutions pay their employees in wages and benefits. What the report showed before the pandemic was that the labor market was very healthy, but it's unclear how employment costs will be affected in the second quarter. Compensation could actually rise since more low-wage workers than high-wage employees have lost their jobs. Or the growth in wages and benefits could both decline sharply. </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

But the company's fattened bottom line was, in large part, due to its real estate of the MGM Grand and Mandalay Bay resorts in Las Vegas. Adjusted for that sale, among other things, losses were 45 cents a share versus earnings of 14 cents a share in the year-ago period. Hurt by shut-down operations in Macau and Las Vegas, among other places, and travel restrictions revenue fell to $2.25 billion from $3.18 billion in the year-ago period. Analysts surveyed by FactSet had estimated adjusted losses of 15 cents a share on revenue of $2.45 billion. MGM said it temporarily has reduced its dividend to a penny a share that will be paid out on an annual basis but will pay out a last quarterly dividend of $0.0025 per share on June 15. The company said it has roughly $7 billion in cash after a recent debt issue. The sale of the MGM Grand and Mandalay Bay real estate was similar to the sale of its flagship Bellagio casino in Las Vegas last year. MGM stock has fallen 36.8% in the past year, with the S&P 500 index  falling 0.2%.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

The coronavirus was first identified in Wuhan, China in December and Trump has recently railed against what he has described as the country's lack of transparency around the severity of the outbreak. Meanwhile, the New York Times reported the Trump officials have \"pushed American spy agencies to hunt for evidence to support\" an unsubstantiated theory that the novel strain of coronavirus was derived from a laboratory in Wuhan. The pandemic has infected more than 3 million people world-wide and claimed more than 230,000 lives, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

afternoon after the Federal Reserve kept rates unchanged, as expected, but vowed to do whatever it takes to help the economy bounce back from the public-health crisis created by COVID-19 pandemic. The Dow Jones Industrial Average  gained 522 points, or 2.2%, at 24,620, the S&P 500 index  rose 2.6% at 2,937, while the Nasdaq Composite Index  climbed 3.4% at 8,895. In a statement following its two-day meeting of the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee, the central bank said: \"The ongoing public health crisis will weigh heavily on economic activity, employment and inflation in the near term, and poses considerable risks to the economic outlook over the medium term.\" The Fed kept its benchmark rate close to a range of 0% and 0.25% and repeated it would hold policy steady until the economy has weathered recent events and \"is on track\" to achieve full employment and price stability. That is unchanged from the March forward guidance. The Fed has already reduced a key interest rate to near zero and increased its balance sheet to $6.6 trillion, adding $2.2 trillion over the course of the past few weeks, as it doled out funds to help prop up the U.S. economy during the coronavirus pandemic. A news conference hosted by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell will be held at 2:30 p.m. Eastern Time. </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

quarter of its workforce due to the economic hit caused by the coronavirus shutdown. In a blog post, co-founder and Chief Executive Steve Kaufer said more than 900 employees will be laid off -- mostly in the U.S. and Canada -- and \"a number\" of employees will be furloughed, while most other salaried workers will be asked to take a 20% pay reduction and reduced work schedule through the summer months. \"Sometimes, the most valiant of efforts aren't enough to counter outside circumstances and, as a public company, it is our responsibility to adjust, adapt and evolve to the environment that surrounds us,\" Kaufer wrote in a letter to employees, noting the company had already undertaken two rounds of cost reductions. \"As CEO, you plan for the best and worst case outcomes that could affect our business. Unfortunately, there is no playbook for this moment that we're in together right now.\" Kaufer thanked all his employees for their efforts and announced the launch of an \"alumni network\" to help the laid-off workers find new jobs. The company will also temporarily pause its 401(k) matching, and will close its offices in San Francisco and Boston, though remaining workers there will be able to work from home.

Arconic split into two standalone companies - Arconic Corporation and Howmet Aerospace Inc. -- on April 1 and the guidance is based on preliminary unaudited financial results from Howmet reported on April 14. The Pittsburgh, Pa.-based company said it expects cost savings implemented to combat the effect of the virus are expected to improve its financial profile by $200 million in 2020. The company's China facilities are now back to normal product, while its Russian packaging facility is running at full operations due to strong end-market demand. The company's New York facility resumed operations on April 20 and the Tennessee plant is expected to ramp up activity this week. \"We are pleased with the recent announcement on April 22(nd) by the ITC initiating antidumping and countervailing duties trade case against 18 countries on common alloy sheet products and we expect this will benefit our operations and others in industrial aluminum processing,\" Chief Executive Tim Myers said in a statement. Arconic has more than $1 billion in liquidity, including about $500 million in cash on its balance sheet, and its maturities are \"well into the future.\" \"Our business is flexible and cash requirements are countercyclical and we expect working capital will be a source of cash in the near team, and together with the benefit of the recent management actions to reduce costs, we believe we have adequate liquidity to operate the Company in spite of ongoing uncertainties,\" Chief Financial Officer Erick Asmussen said in the statement. </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

solidly higher as investors took solace in the passage of another round of stimulus and a continued rebound in oil prices after a headlong crash earlier this week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average  rose 260 points, or 1.1% to end at around 23,775, the S&P 500 index added about 40 points, or 1.4% to 28,37 and the Nasdaq Composite index  advanced 140 points, or 1.7%, to close at roughly 8,635. For the week, the Dow lost 1.9%, the S&P 500 retreated 1.3% and the Nasdaq shed 0.2%, snapping a two-week winning streak for the indexes. President Trump signed a $484 billion stimulus package that will replenish a fund for small-business lending and direct money to hospitals and efforts to ramp up U.S. testing capacity in the fight against COVID-19. The bill will bring total federal spending on coronvirus to north of $2.7 trillion. Also helping lift sentiment was a third-straight day of gains for oil, following a major decline in prices earlier in the week that had fueled global growth worries.  West Texas Intermediate crude for June delivery  still ended the week down more than 30%, it's worst weekly decline on record. Investors were also eyeing corporate earnings results. Dow components American Express Co. , Intel Corp.  and Verizon Communications Inc.  all gained Friday after beating first-quarter profit expectations.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.
