11255,"@rolandoflondon I remember our play.  I needed your sense of humor, yesterday.  Rebuy?  You didn't even buy once 😃"
11256,"I reraised he called. River was a Q, I bet.  He shoved (not much more). I called and lost to 4-5.  Fun game."
11257,Hand details:  with JJ in the small blind I reraised Trickett. Flop was j-6-2 rainbow. I bet he called. Turn was a 3. I bet he raised.
11258,Ok. That didn't go well. First one out.  Couldn't make it an hour.   Tough hand.   ...  Try again at the main event. :(
11259,They finally drew tables.  Old times: I have Sam Trickett on my right. Vanessa Selbst next to him. Fun stuff.  We may start soon.  :)

11266,2nd break.  Losing an evil amount of small pots.  21k.

11289,"Fourth: I want to thank my family, friends and partners for sweating me.  You know who you are."

14408,It’s looking like Bloomberg versus Sanders.  Have to applaud that.  Both are in it to win the battle for the soul of the Democratic Party.

14419,Bernie getting close to Joe on Predicit.  Here comes Iowa!
14420,I will give Bloomberg credit for one thing. Having the wisdom to realize this debate culling process is poor.  There has to be a better way.
14421,The Democratic debate is about half over.  Unequivocal  winner is already obvious: President Trump. There seems to be no Democratic vision.
14422,Mayor Mike is running ads saying he’s never taken money from special interests.  But all his funding is from a single special interest: Him.
14423,Buffalo Common Council President Darius Pridgen said it best: “Mark Croce believed in Buffalo before Buffalo believed in itself.”
14424,Perhaps Mark Croce ran out of fuel for the helicopter (which is my guess). But he was the fuel for the Chippewa district miracle.  RIP Mark.

14449,"If there is a betting site where you can short the Patriots to win the SuperBowl, go all in."

14451,"Cowboys owned at home Thanksgiving.  Ravens coming to Buffalo! Two great teams, two great young QB’s. Should be on national TV.  Go Bills!!!"
14452,Mayor Pete killed it tonight.
14453,Poor Kamala Harris and Cory Booker. Deval is ahead of both of them in the Predictit betting odds (which have been more accurate than polls).
14454,"Deval Patrick has joined the race for the Dem nomination.  Who, you say?  How many donors is this guy going to get?  Dems in utter disarray."
14455,Josh Allen has had receivers open on the vertical many times this season. To his credit he has read it. But he has not once made the throw.
14456,No question Josh Allen has a cannon arm but he’s yet to connect on a deep vertical route in his Bills career!Every try’s been a wasted down.
14457,Mayor Pete is very smart.  His Hunger Games “let them kill each other” strategy is perfect.  Can you name a single policy Pete’s advocating?
14458,Warren was soarin’ until the price tag of “I have a plan for that” was even partially revealed. There is nothing “free” &amp; everyone knows it.
14459,"What?!

I’m hearing tentative respect for the Bills in sports media!

Winning at Cleveland this Sunday is a must to deserve it.

14460,"When the Boston Herald says the liberal senior Senator from Massachusetts has no chance of winning, it’s worth noting.  That just happened."
14461,"Bills home opener tomorrow!  

Go Bills!"
14462,At this point in time before the 2016 Republican primary race Jeb was already in freefall. So the Dem situation this time is not the same.
14463,"Months into the Dem Primary race many “running” are polling near 0%. Who is funding them, and why? Anti-Trumpers, and delusion/desperation.."
14464,"Hillary spoke at Arena Academy NY.  Looked a bit like, just maybe, she is thinking about jumping into any upcoming opening in the Dem field."
14465,Watched 2 videos today on the topic of MMT from chief advocates. The degrees of slight of hand &amp; pretzel logic literally made my brain hurt.
14466,What is all this nonsense about “Brexit”?  Since Britain never adopted the Euro there was never in fact a “Brenter”.  Not really.
14467,I will not post anything more about Joe Biden.  I thank him for his decades of public service.
14468,"Joe Biden: “What would have happened if Barrack Obama had been assassinated?” Hey Joe. Where are you going with this?  I say Nowhere, fast.."
14469,Now on view at the Hood Museum of Art at Dartmouth College is a soft sculpture “couch” by Yayoi Kusama.  It is a masterpiece of modern art.
14470,I watched Sliden’ Biden’s Iowa State fair speech from this past weekend today. Horrific. Jurassic Joe needs to join Hickenlooper.....pronto.
14471,"Way back, when the world was young, 30Y USTs were given the moniker “certificates of confiscation”. That was darned near the 30Y yield peak."
14472,"30Y UST at its lowest yield ever is being touted as a “buy” about as loudly as the 10Y was July 6, 2016 when its yield troughed at 1.32%."
14473,“Slidin’ Biden” placed in a statistical tie with “Soarin’ Warren” in the “YouGov for The Economist” National poll released today.
14474,Obviously the US economy is not “overheating”. Many inputs to the Conference Board’s Leading Economic Indicators are worse now than in 2007.
14475,"And yet, commentary in mainstream media this past week pushed a narrative that the Fed should raise rates due to economy “overheating”. Wow."
14476,New converts to the “negative US yields are imminent” crowd were out in force today just before the 30 yr UST price decline began.  Classic.
14477,Poor Jay Powell. Messaging pivots have been required at every press conference since Dec. Don’t expect to hear “mid-cycle adjustment” again.
14478,"The US Treasury market yield levels reached today imply not only certainty of a September rate cut, but more than 1/3 chance of fully 50 bp."
14479,"Over 600,000 people in the United States die of heart disease each year."
14480,"National car crash deaths 2018 estimated to be 40,000 by the NSC."
14481,"Drug overdose deaths twelve months ending September 2018 reported to be 70,000."
14482,&gt;300 Chicago gun deaths past 12 months &amp; about the same number of mass shooting deaths nationally. Both so awful. Yet no outrage re:Chicago.
14483,"US Gov profligacy finally being reported
by mainstream media (WSJ). Interesting to see how that will jibe w/ reporting on Dem Prez hopefuls."
14484,Weak Treasury auction parade marches on despite a drumbeat of weaker economic data.  Don’t be fooled: rate cut next week is not “insurance”.
14485,New CNN poll: “Slidin’ Biden” ahead by 5 thin pts over new 2nd placer Harris. Warren + Sanders (relevant due to similar views) up 7 on Joe.
14486,"Biden’s “raise your hand for undocumented healthcare” moment was so telling. He sorta raised a hand, only after looking to his left &amp; right."
14487,I said at Sohn Biden has no chance.  Joe’s performance tonight proved it.
14488,"Online video of 1957 Mike Wallace interview with James Eastland is worth watching, particularly if followed by recent Jonathan Kozol video."
14489,Everyone agrees recycling is a good thing in concept. Why do public schools not teach “how to recycle”?What good are bins without knowledge?
14490,Trump: “I didn’t want to kill 150 Iranians” re: aborted strike. Chilling as I recall reading about Civil War casualty projections from 1861.
14491,DXY now up all of 5 bp YTD.  The “dollar  is strong” rhetoric dominating financial media ignores the facts. DXY likely to end the year down.
14492,Moment of truth for DXY. Closed today right on top of 9 month uptrend and just above 200-day MA.  And gold broke out above it’s huge base.
14493,"Kusama’s innovations include soft sculpture art  (Oldenburg took it), wallpaper art (Warhol took it), mirror room art (Samaras took it)."
14494,"The film “Kusama Infinity” is a profile in courage,  genius, perseverance &amp; acceptance against all odds. Highly recommended. Love you Yayoi!"
14495,"Fed message today was essentially: the case for easing has strengthened, we hope that changes soon, if it doesn’t we’re behind the curve."
14496,"Fed statement, dots and presser all under the microscope Wednesday.  Stock bear market has retraced large but bonds are screaming for cuts."
14497,$ rolling over. Gold up 8 days in a row. Don’t envy the Fed which announces in 10 days. Market pricing: 4 cuts more likely than 1 by yr end.
14498,Didn’t take long for “Jurassic Joe” Biden to step in it despite attempts to hide rather than campaign. Plagiarism &amp; big flip-flop in 1 week!
14499,President Trump says US is the “piggy bank” the rest of the world wants to steal from. But the US has $124 Trillion in unfunded liabilities!
14500,"TLT put/call straddle idea at Sohn up 22% in the month since.  Rare instant gratification.  If you put it on, taking it off now makes sense."
14501,Roger Goodell: NFL wants a new Bills stadium so the team “remains competitive”.  Since when is it the stadium that makes a team competitive?
14502,"DB price action looking pretty scary.  And Soc Gen, still run by the indefatigably incompetent Oudea, is heading straight south yet again."
14503,Long maturity US Treasury price action today was consistent with a blowoff momentum top. I suspect buyer’s remorse will set in fairly soon.
14504,"Robert O’Rourke’s CNN Town Hall appearance last night attracted fewer viewers than that of John Hicken-who?-per back in March.  Bye, “Beto”."
14505,The outcome AK360 hopes to achieve would reap economic benefits to Buffalo and Erie County far exceeding the public funds so wisely pledged.
14506,"Erie County NY legislator Joe Lorigo: “renege on the $5mm AK360 pledge; infrastructure is more important”. Uh, AK360 is infrastructure, man!"
14507,"Great 1st round draft Bills!!  Welcome to Buffalo Ed Oliver, who poetically said “I don’t think I found my home.  I think my home found me.”"
14508,"Respect everyone, know life is unfair, take risk, step up in the tough times, face down bullies, lift the downtrodden &amp; never, ever give up."
14509,Three months ago the Fed predicted totally different policy than where they are now.  How can they predict 2020 policy with a straight face?
14510,The U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) just fell below its 200-day Moving Average.
14511,I read 200 Federal Agents worked for a year on the College Admission Scandal. Don’t think those resources were spent for just 33 probations.
14512,"Goal of 2% not just future inflation, but for the future to make up for past “shortfalls” means the real Fed goal is prices 2x every 35 yrs."
14513,Achieving more of the SocGen definition of “success” hapless Oudea announced today he is weighing cutting 1000’s of investment banking jobs.
14514,"So Fed is saying they not only will allow, but
actually desire CPI to rise above 2%!  Bond market is getting boiled like a frog in a pot."
14515,Fed: “two ‘19 hikes &amp; Auto QT” in mere weeks turned into “patient &amp; maybe QE regular tool”. Now it’s “past &lt;2% CPI needs future &gt;2% offset”.
